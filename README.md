# Helmet-No-Helmet-Detection
The Helmet Detection and Alert System is a real-time computer vision application designed to ensure safety compliance by detecting whether individuals are wearing helmets. It uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 deep learning model to distinguish between people with and without helmets through a live webcam feed.
