Helmet Detection System 🚴‍♂️🛡️
This project is a real-time Helmet Detection System built using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.
It opens your webcam live, detects whether a person is wearing a helmet or not, and sounds an alert beep when a person without a helmet is detected.

📸 How It Works
Webcam opens automatically on running the program.

YOLO model (best.pt) processes each frame.

If helmet is detected, it counts and displays.

If no helmet is detected, it:

Plays a beep alert (winsound used for Windows systems).

Logs detection details like timestamp, class, confidence, and person ID.

Live counts of helmet and no-helmet detections are shown on the video.

Press 'q' to exit safely.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time helmet detection from webcam feed.

✅ Alert sound when a person is detected without a helmet.

✅ Logging of each detection with timestamp into a text file (detections_log.txt).

✅ Live counter for number of helmets and no-helmets.

✅ Smooth and fast detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.8+

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Ultralytics (for YOLOv8)

winsound (built-in for Windows)

Install requirements:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python numpy ultralytics
🧠 Model Details
The YOLOv8 model (best.pt) is trained to classify:

Class 0 → Helmet

Class 1 → No Helmet

(If your model's classes are different, adjust the class IDs in the script.)

▶️ How To Run
Make sure best.pt is placed in the same folder as the script.

Run the Python script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python helmet_detection.py
Your webcam will open live, and detections will start!

📌 Notes
The beep alert only plays for detections without helmets.

Detection logs will be saved automatically into detections_log.txt.

If the webcam does not open:

Check if the webcam is free (no other apps using it).

Allow access if permission is required.

Try using cv2.VideoCapture(1) if you have multiple cameras.
